Don't be mad at me.\nDisclosure: I am not a pianist and I can't play something so difficult. Instead, I worked on an original MIDI file that was supposedly played by Mieczys≈Çaw Munz (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mieczys%C5%82aw_Munz). I am not sure about that because Munz died before the invention of the MIDI format, thought.",
